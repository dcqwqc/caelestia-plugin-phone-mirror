// The scrcpy mirror of the handset, as a quick toggle.
//
// This used to be a .desktop entry in the app launcher, which could only ever
// start it. A toggle has to answer "is it up?" as well, and has to keep
// answering: the mirror is closed from its own window, or dies when the phone
// leaves wifi, at least as often as it is switched off from here.
//
// So the state is not polled -- it is read off the compositor. The launcher
// pins a fixed window title on scrcpy, so the mirror's toplevel appearing IS
// the connection coming up and it vanishing IS the connection going away, with
// no interval in which the toggle disagrees with reality.
